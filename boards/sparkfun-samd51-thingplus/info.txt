Add uf2-samdx1 board config and updated bootloader
Since the board config used to build the original bootloader appears
to have been lost, this commit includes a reconstructed board config.
Importantly, this board config also corrects the microcontroller model
to SAMD51J20A.

VENDOR_NAME was copied from the SAMD51 MicroMod board config.
INDEX_URL links to the SAMD51 Thing Plus product page.
PRODUCT_NAME and BOARD_ID were copied from INFO_UF2.TXT in
bootloader mode.
VOLUME_LABEL, USB_VID, and USB_PID were copied from the device
details in bootloader mode.

LED_PIN was set using the SAMD51 Thing Plus graphical datasheet.

BOOT_USART_* was configured for the pins broken out as D0 (RX) and
D1 (TX) using SERCOM2 as shown in the SAMD51 Thing Plus graphical
datasheet. This UART configuration is untested and may be incorrect.

Adafruit maintains a more active fork of the uf2-samdx1 repo than the
original Microsoft repo, so I chose to build a new bootloader from that.

Instructions for building:
1. Clone the uf2-samdx1 repo: https://github.com/adafruit/uf2-samdx1
2. Check out the latest tag (e.g. v3.13.0).
3. Copy the `sparkfun-samd51-thingplus` folder from this repo to the
   `boards` folder in the uf2-samdx1 clone.
4. Run the make command: `make BOARD=sparkfun-samd51-thingplus`
5. Find the new bootloader and updater binaries in the
   `build/sparkfun-samd51-thingplus` folder.

Note: if the bootloader version number included in the filename contains
a `-dirty` suffix, that means the bootloader repo contains untracked
changes and, depending on the content of those changes, it may be
impossible to reproduce that build in the future. Best practice is to
only build from unmodified commits that are present in the upstream
repo, and preferably tagged commits if possible.
